# # The trainer is a kind of support vector machine and therefore has the usual
# # SVM C parameter.  In general, a bigger C encourages it to fit the training
# # data better but might lead to overfitting.  You must find the best C value
# # empirically by checking how well the trained detector works on a test set of
# # images you haven't trained on.  Don't just leave the value set at 5.  Try a

# # This function does the actual training.  It will save the final detector to
# # detector.svm.  The input is an XML file that lists the images in the training
# # dataset and also contains the positions of the face boxes.  To create your
# # own XML files you can use the imglab tool which can be found in the
# # tools/imglab folder.  It is a simple graphical tool for labeling objects in
# # images with boxes.  To see how to use it read the tools/imglab/README.txt
# # file.  But for this example, we just use the training.xml file included with
# # dlib.

#
# # Now that we have a face detector we can test it.  The first statement tests
# # it on the training data.  It will print(the precision, recall, and then)
# # average precision.

# # However, to get an idea if it really worked without overfitting we need to
# # run it on images it wasn't trained on.  The next line does this.  Happily, we
# # see that the object detector works perfectly on the testing images.
